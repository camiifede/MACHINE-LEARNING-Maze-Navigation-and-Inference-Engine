# Description
Implemented multiple search algorithms including A*, Bidirectional Greedy Search, and Backward Chaining to solve maze navigation problems in an environment with obstacles.

#Features

•	Designed and optimized search strategies using Manhattan heuristics, custom data structures, and priority queues to dynamically explore state spaces and reconstruct optimal or near-optimal paths.

•	Engineered logical reasoning modules using First-Order Logic and Generalized Modus Ponens to infer movement paths and evaluate navigability without direct search.

•	Built interactive visualizations in Python to simulate agent movement and frontier expansion; included step-by-step path reconstruction and real-time debugging output.

•	Extended solutions to randomized environments to validate algorithm robustness under increased complexity and obstacle variation.

•	Compared computational efficiency, path optimality, and memory usage across methods, gaining practical insight into AI reasoning and search behaviour.
